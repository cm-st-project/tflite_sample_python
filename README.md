# TensorFlow Lite Image Classifier

This project contains a Python script that utilizes a TensorFlow Lite model to classify images. The script loads a pre-trained TFLite model, processes an input image, and outputs the classification results.

## Features

- Load a TensorFlow Lite model.
- Process images for model input.
- Classify images and output predictions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or newer
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pillow (PIL)

## Installation

To set up your environment to run this script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed on your system.
2. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pillow
```

## Usage

To use the script, you need to have a TFLite model file and a corresponding labels text file. Place your image file in the same directory as the script or specify the path to it.

Run the script using:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Files Description

- `main.py`: Main script to load the model, process the image, and classify it.
- `model_unquant1.tflite`: TensorFlow Lite model file (ensure you have this file in the same directory).
- `labels.txt`: Text file containing labels corresponding to the model's output.
- `perch.jpg`: Example image file for testing the classifier.

## Model Details

This script is configured to use a model named `model_unquant1.tflite`. Ensure that you replace `"model_unquant1.tflite"` and `"labels.txt"` in the script with the paths to your actual model and labels files, respectively.
